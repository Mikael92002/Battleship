# Battleship
A modern take on the classic **Battleship** game featuring a smart AI opponent. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project demonstrates game logic and design, AI algorithms, and web design.

## Features
* **Intelligent AI opponent**: Uses a custom-made AI algorithm that prioritizes efficiency and scalability by separating the AI's behavior as a separate class of its own.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Clickable grid interface for easy ship placement and attacks on any device, alongside helpful written feedback after each click.
* **Modular Code**: Follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) organization to implement best practices and maintainable code.

## Tech Stack
* **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Algorithms**: Custom AI decision-making algorithm
* **Tools**: Webpack, VS Code, Chrome DevTools

## How to Play
**1.** Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mikael92002/Battleship.git
```
**2.** Open ```index.html``` in your browser.
**3.** Place your ships on the grid.
**4.** Take turns attacking the opponent. The AI pauses before making their move to simulate human behavior.
**5.** Win by sinking all enemy ships before they sink yours
